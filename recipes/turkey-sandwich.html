    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A turkey sandwich usually consists of sliced roasted turkey breast between two slices of bread, often with lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise or mustard. It's a simple, tasty, and satisfying meal.</p>
    <p>Turkey sandwiches are highly customisable and need not have turkey, but that would not be a turkey sandwich then.</p>
